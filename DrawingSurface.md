## `DrawingSurface` functions and properties

The DrawingSurface family of functions allow you to directly draw onto
dynamic sprites and room backgrounds in the game. You get a drawing
surface by calling
[`DynamicSprite.GetDrawingSurface`](DynamicSprite#dynamicspritegetdrawingsurface)
or
[`Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground`](Room#roomgetdrawingsurfaceforbackground),
and you can then use the following methods to draw onto the surface.

**IMPORTANT:** You **MUST** call the
[`Release`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacerelease) method when you have
finished drawing onto the surface. This allows AGS to update its cached
copies of the image and upload it to video memory if appropriate.

### `DrawingSurface.Clear`

*(Formerly known as `RawClearScreen`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.Clear(optional int color)

Clears the surface to the specified COLOR (this is a number you can
find in the Colors pane of the editor). The current contents of the
surface will be lost.

If you do not supply the COLOR parameter, or use COLOR_TRANSPARENT,
the surface will be cleared to be fully transparent.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.Clear(14);
    surface.DrawingColor = 13;
    surface.DrawCircle(160,100,50);
    surface.Release();

clears the room background to be fully yellow, then draws a pink circle
in the middle of it.

[`DrawingSurface.DrawingColor`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawingcolor)

### `DrawingSurface.CreateCopy`

*(Formerly known as `RawSaveScreen`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface* DrawingSurface.CreateCopy()

Makes a backup copy of the current surface, in order that it can be
restored later. This could be useful to back up a background scene
before writing over it, or to save a certain state of your drawing to
restore later.

Unlike the obsolete RawSaveScreen command in previous versions of AGS,
backup surfaces created with this command are not lost when the player
changes room or restores a game. However, surfaces containing a copy of
room backgrounds can be **very large**, using up a large amount of
memory and can increase the save game sizes significantly. Therefore, it
is **strongly recommended** that you Release any backup copy surfaces as
soon as you are done with them.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    DrawingSurface *backup = surface.CreateCopy();
    surface.DrawTriangle(0,0,160,100,0,200);
    Wait(80);
    surface.DrawSurface(backup);
    backup.Release();
    surface.Release();

will save a copy of the room background, draw a triangle onto it, wait
for a while and then restore the original background.

[`DrawingSurface.DrawSurface`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawsurface)

### `DrawingSurface.DrawCircle`

*(Formerly known as `RawDrawCircle`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawCircle(int x, int y, int radius)

Draws a filled circle of radius RADIUS with its center at (X,Y) in the
current drawing color.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawCircle(160,100,50);
    surface.Release();

will draw a circle in the center of the screen, of 50 pixels radius.

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawLine`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawline),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawingColor`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawingcolor)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawImage`

*(Formerly known as `RawDrawImage`, which is now obsolete)*<br>
*(Formerly known as `RawDrawImageResized`, which is now obsolete)*<br>
*(Formerly known as `RawDrawImageTransparent`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawImage(int x, int y, int slot, optional int transparency,
                             optional int width, optional int height)

Draws image SLOT from the sprite manager onto the surface at location
(X,Y).

Optionally, you can also specify the transparency of the image. This is
a number from 0-100; using a *transparency* of 50 will draw the image
semi-transparent; using 0 means it will not be transparent.

You can also resize the image as you draw it. In order to do this,
simply specify a *width* and *height* that you wish to resize the image
to when it is drawn.

**NOTE:** This command only works if the image to be drawn is the same
color depth as the surface that you are drawing onto.

**NOTE:** Transparency does not work in 256-color games, or with
256-color sprites.

**NOTE:** The X and Y co-ordinates given are ROOM co-ordinates, not
SCREEN co-ordinates. This means that in a scrolling room you can draw
outside the current visible area.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawImage(100, 100, oDoor.Graphic, 40);
    surface.Release();

will draw the *oDoor* object's graphic onto the room background at (100,
100), at `40%` transparency.

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawLine`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawline),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawString`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawstring),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawSurface`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawsurface),

### `DrawingSurface.DrawLine`

*(Formerly known as `RawDrawLine`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawLine(int from_x, int from_y, int to_x, int to_y,
                            optional int thickness)

Draws a line from (FROM_X, FROM_Y) to (TO_X, TO_Y) in the surface's
current drawing color.

The *thickness* parameter allows you to specify how thick the line is,
the default being 1 pixel.

**NOTE:** The X and Y co-ordinates given are ROOM co-ordinates, not
SCREEN co-ordinates. This means that in a scrolling room you can draw
outside the current visible area.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawLine(0, 0, 160, 100);
    surface.Release();

will draw a line from the left top of the screen (0,0) to the middle of
the screen (160,100);

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawCircle`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawcircle),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawRectangle`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawrectangle),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawTriangle`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawtriangle),

### `DrawingSurface.DrawMessageWrapped`

*(Formerly known as `RawPrintMessageWrapped`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawMessageWrapped(int x, int y, int width,
                                      FontType font, int message_number)

Draws the room message MESSAGE_NUMBER onto the surface at (x,y), using
the specified FONT.

WIDTH is the width of the virtual textbox enclosing the text, and is the
point that the text will wrap at. This command is designed for writing a
long message to the screen with it wrapping normally like a standard
label would do.

The text will be printed using the current drawing color.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawMessageWrapped(80, 40, 160, Game.NormalFont, 10);
    surface.Release();

will display message 10 in the center of the screen, starting from Y =
40.

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawString`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawstring),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawingColor`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawingcolor),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawStringWrapped`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawstringwrapped)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawPixel`

    DrawingSurface.DrawPixel(int x, int y)

Draws a single pixel onto the surface at (X,Y) in the current color.
The pixel thickness respects the
[`UseHighResCoordinates`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfaceusehighrescoordinates)
property.

**NOTE:** This command is not fast enough to use repeatedly to build up
an image. Only use it for single pixel adjustments.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawPixel(50, 50);
    surface.Release();

draws a yellow pixel in the top left of the room background

*See also:*

[`DrawingSurface.DrawLine`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawline),
[`DrawingSurface.GetPixel`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacegetpixel),
[`DrawingSurface.UseHighResCoordinates`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfaceusehighrescoordinates)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawRectangle`

*(Formerly known as `RawDrawRectangle`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawRectangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2)

Draws a filled rectangle in the current color with its top-left corner
at (x1,y1) and its bottom right corner at (x2, y2)

**NOTE:** The X and Y co-ordinates given are ROOM co-ordinates, not
SCREEN co-ordinates. This means that in a scrolling room you can draw
outside the current visible area.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawRectangle(0, 0, 160, 100);
    surface.Release();

will draw a rectangle over the top left hand quarter of the screen.

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawImage`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawimage),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawLine`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawline)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawString`

*(Formerly known as `RawPrint`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawString(int x, int y, FontType font, string text, ...)

Draws the *text* onto the surface at (x, y), using the supplied font
number. The text will be drawn in the current drawing color.

You can insert the value of variables into the message. For more
information, see the [string formatting](StringFormats)
section.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawString(0, 100, Game.NormalFont, "Text written into the background!");
    surface.Release();

will write some text onto the middle-left of the room background

*See also:* [`GetTextWidth`](Globalfunctions_General#gettextwidth),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawStringWrapped`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawstringwrapped),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawingColor`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawingcolor)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawStringWrapped`

    DrawingSurface.DrawStringWrapped(int x, int y, int width,
                                     FontType font, Alignment,
                                     const string text)

Draws the *text* onto the surface at (x,y), using the specified FONT.

*width* is the width of the virtual textbox enclosing the text, and is
the point that the text will wrap at. You can use the *alignment*
parameter to determine how the text is horizontally aligned.

The text will be printed using the current drawing color.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawStringWrapped(80, 40, 160, Game.NormalFont, eAlignCentre, "Hello, my name is Bob.");
    surface.Release();

will display the text in the center of the screen, starting from Y = 40.

*Compatibility:* Supported by **AGS 3.0.1** and later versions.

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawString`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawstring),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawingColor`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawingcolor),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawMessageWrapped`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawmessagewrapped)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawSurface`

*(Formerly known as `RawDrawFrameTransparent`, which is now obsolete)*<br>
*(Formerly known as `RawRestoreScreen`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawSurface(DrawingSurface *source, optional int transparency)

Draws the specified surface on top of this surface, optionally using
*transparency* percent transparency.

This allows you to perform day-to-night fading and other special
effects.

**NOTE:** You cannot use the *transparency* parameter with 256-color
surfaces.

**NOTE:** This command can be a bit on the slow side, so don't call it
from repeatedly_execute.

**TIP:** If you want to gradually fade in a second background, create a
copy of the original surface and then restore it after each iteration,
otherwise the backgrounds will converge too quickly.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *mainBackground = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground(0);
    DrawingSurface *nightBackground = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground(1);
    mainBackground.DrawSurface(nightBackground, 50);
    mainBackground.Release();
    nightBackground.Release();

this will draw background frame 1 onto frame 0 at 50`%` opacity.

[`SetAmbientTint`](Globalfunctions_General#setambienttint)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawTriangle`

*(Formerly known as `RawDrawTriangle`, which is now obsolete)*

    DrawingSurface.DrawTriangle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int x3, int y3)

Draws a filled triangle in the current color with corners at the points
(x1,y1), (x2,y2) and (x3,y3).

Well, don't look at me, you might find it useful for something :-)

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawTriangle(0,0,160,100,0,200);
    surface.Release();

will draw a triangle with corners at the points (0,0),(160,100),(0,200).

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawImage`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawimage),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawLine`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawline),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawRectangle`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawrectangle)

---

### `DrawingSurface.Release`

    DrawingSurface.Release()

Tells AGS that you have finished drawing onto this surface, and that AGS
can now upload the changed image into video memory.

After calling this method, you can no longer use the DrawingSurface
instance. To do any further drawing, you need to get the surface again.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawLine(0, 0, 50, 50);
    surface.Release();

draws a yellow diagonal line across the top-left of the current room
background, then releases the image.

*See also:*
[`DynamicSprite.GetDrawingSurface`](DynamicSprite#dynamicspritegetdrawingsurface),
[`Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground`](Room#roomgetdrawingsurfaceforbackground)

---

### `DrawingSurface.DrawingColor`

*(Formerly known as `RawSetColor`, which is now obsolete)*

    int DrawingSurface.DrawingColor

Gets/sets the current drawing color on this surface. Set this before
using commands like [`DrawLine`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawline), which
use this color for their drawing.

You can set this either to an AGS Color Number (as you'd get from the
Colors pane in the editor) or to the special constant
COLOR_TRANSPARENT, which allows you to draw transparent areas onto the
surface.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    surface.DrawingColor = 14;
    surface.DrawLine(0, 0, 160, 100);
    surface.DrawingColor = Game.GetColorFromRGB(255, 255, 255);
    surface.DrawLine(0, 199, 160, 100);
    surface.Release();

will draw a yellow line from the left top of the screen (0,0) to the
middle of the screen (160,100), and a white line from the bottom left to
the middle.

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawCircle`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawcircle),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawLine`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawline),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawRectangle`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawrectangle),
[`Game.GetColorFromRGB`](Game#gamegetcolorfromrgb)

---

### `DrawingSurface.GetPixel`

    int DrawingSurface.GetPixel(int x, int y)

Returns the AGS Color Number of the pixel at (X,Y) on the surface.

**NOTE:** In high-color games, the first 32 color numbers have a
special meaning due to an AGS feature which maintains compatibility with
8-bit games. Therefore, if you draw onto the surface using a blue color
number 0-31 you will get a different number when you GetPixel -- and in
fact the color drawn may not be what you expect. To get around this,
add 1 Red or Green component to adjust the color number out of this
range.

**NOTE:** This command is relatively slow. Don't use it to try and
process an entire image.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    Display("The color of the middle pixel is %d.", surface.GetPixel(160, 100));
    surface.Release();

displays the pixel color of the center pixel on the screen.

*Compatibility:* Supported by **AGS 3.0.1** and later versions.

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.DrawingColor`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawingcolor),
[`DrawingSurface.DrawPixel`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacedrawpixel),
[`DrawingSurface.UseHighResCoordinates`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfaceusehighrescoordinates)

---

### `DrawingSurface.Height`

    readonly int DrawingSurface.Height

Gets the height of the surface.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    Display("The background is %d x %d!", surface.Width, surface.Height);
    surface.Release();

displays the size of the surface to the player

*See also:*
[`DrawingSurface.UseHighResCoordinates`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfaceusehighrescoordinates),
[`DrawingSurface.Width`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacewidth)

---

### `DrawingSurface.UseHighResCoordinates`

**This property is obsolete since AGS 3.5.0 and not recommended for use at all.**

    bool DrawingSurface.UseHighResCoordinates

Gets/sets whether you want to use high-resolution co-ordinates with this
surface.

By default, this property will be set such that drawing surface
co-ordinates use the same co-ordinate system as the rest of the game, as
per the "Use low-res co-ordinates in script" game setting. However, if
your game is 640x400 or higher you can customize whether this drawing
surface uses native co-ordinates or the low-res 320x200 co-ordinates by
changing this property.

Setting this property affects **ALL** other commands performed on this
drawing surface, including the [`Width`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfacewidth)
and [`Height`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfaceheight) properties.

**IMPORTANT:** This property is a remnant of the old and since deprecated feature in AGS which allowed to treat all coordinates in high-resolution games as if they were for low-resolution. For example: have 640x400 game but use 320x200 measurements in script, which would make each drawing operation to be performed x2 thicker on screen.<br>
Since AGS 3.5.0 this property is ignored unless you have backwards-compatible "Allow relative asset resolutions" option enabled in General Settings.

---

### `DrawingSurface.Width`

    readonly int DrawingSurface.Width

Gets the width of the surface.

Example:

    DrawingSurface *surface = Room.GetDrawingSurfaceForBackground();
    Display("The background is %d x %d!", surface.Width, surface.Height);
    surface.Release();

displays the size of the surface to the player

*See also:* [`DrawingSurface.Height`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfaceheight),
[`DrawingSurface.UseHighResCoordinates`](DrawingSurface#drawingsurfaceusehighrescoordinates)
