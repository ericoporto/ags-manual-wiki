## Room Editor

The Room Editor is where you can define the various properties and data that
make up a room. This includes:

- Objects
- Hotspots
- Walkable areas
- Walkbehinds
- Regions
- ...and more!

**NOTE:** Currently only one room can be open for editing at a time

### Controls

**Pan**

If your room is large enough that scrollbars are shown and required to move around
in the room, you can also pan by either holding spacebar and left-click dragging the room background,
or alternatively holding your mouse middle click button.

**Zoom**

In the upper top of the room bar there is a zoom slider than can be used to adjust the zoom,
but alternatively holding ctrl and using the mouse scrollwheel (or scroll gesture in some touchpads)
will also adjust zoom.

**Context Menu**

Right clicking should bring the context menu. There is a special case for area editing modes (Hotspots, Walkable areas, and alike) in which right click works as a "eraser"; in these modes context menu is called by a Shift + RMB combination.
The context menu will usually contain the "Copy mouse coordinates to clipboard" command, but it can contain
additional options depending on active layer or what is right clicked - like a character or an object.

### Background

By selecting a background on the `Display Background` combo box, you can select
which background of a room to display: Main Background, frame 2, 3, 4, 5. With
one background selected, click `Change...` button to replace the background
image with a new image. If a room has more than one background, by default, they
are animated. To prevent that assign "BackgroundAnimtionEnabled" to "False" in the room properties. Also, you may lock background to a particular frame in script using [`SetBackgroundFrame`](Globalfunctions_Room#setbackgroundframe) command.

**NOTE:** If the background images are replaced with ones of a different size
this will clear all of the mask (hotspot, walkbehind, region, and walkable)
areas which have been are defined so far.

### Edit this room's control

This control allows you to view characters, objects, and edges, simultaneously
along with one of the room masks: hotspots, walkable areas, walk-behinds or
regions. Moving a character or object already in the room is done by clicking
and dragging it.

![Editor Room](images/EditorRoom_2.png)

You can select any element in the room by navigating on the bar using the down
arrows, which will reveal the available elements of the chosen category.

Characters and objects can also be selected directly in the room, by clicking on
them, as long as the corresponding layer is active.

To select any mask-type layer, first select the layer you are interested and
then use the Select area tool (picker icon on toolbar) to pick the specific
element.

**Placing a new object**

If you want to place a new object, you can do so by selecting Objects in the
layer menu and right clicking on the screen where you would like to create it. A
new context menu should open and you can choose the option "Place New Object
Here".

**Placing a character**

Characters will only be shown if this room is their 'starting room'. You can
modify this by expanding the "Characters" node in the Explore Project tree, and
configuring the property `StartingRoom` for a particular character.

**Layer and element Visibility (eye icon)**

Each layer can be made visible/hidden by toggling its visibility button on and
off. In addition, for the object, character, and edge layers, each element in
the layer can also be made be hidden in the same way.

**NOTE:** This will only affect the editor, not the actual game

**Layer and element Locking (padlock icon)**

Each layer can be locked/unlocked by by toggling its locking button. In
addition, for each layer, each element in the layer can also be locked/unlocked
in a similar way. A locked element cannot be moved until it is unlocked, this is
useful to prevent accidentally moving something when designing the room.

**NOTE:** This will only affect the editor, not the actual game

### Properties control

The properties control will adapt to whichever element is selected on the
current layer. If no element is selected or the edges layer is selected, this
control will show the current Room properties and events.

The list button switches the control to show **Properties** and the button with
a lighting bolt on it switches the control to show **Events**. Both can be
navigated either in categorical order or alphabetical order.

Positional changes on the properties of an element (e.g. its x or y position)
will instantly be updated in the room area, which is useful for pixel
positioning.

### Room Properties

-   **Description** - this is an optional room description, which may also serve as a room's name.
-   **Number** - room's number is its ID. Changing this property will renumber the room and rename its files.
-   **BackgroundAnimationDelay** - the delay between room background frames switch, in game ticks. This value only has a meaning when room has multiple backgrounds, and **BackgroundAnimationEnabled** is turned on.
-   **BackgroundAnimationEnabled** - whether the background frames will switch automatically over time. This value only has a meaning when room has multiple backgrounds.
-   **MaskResolution** - defines the ratio of masks (walkable, hotspot and region) vs room background size. Default is 1:1, but few other choice are available, like 1:2, 1:3 and 1:4. The higher the last number is, the less precise the mask is. This setting exists mostly for the backwards compatibility, or for exotic scenarios where you may want to have hotspot or walkable area to have lower resolution than the room itself. Note that walk-behind mask is not affected by this, and always has 1:1 ratio with the room background.
-   **PlayerCharacterView** - when set to a non-zero value, the player character will be changed to this View when the room is loaded. Note that you may also use script command ["ChangeView"](Character#characterchangeview) for the same purpose.
-   **Properties** - lets you configure room's Custom Properties. Please see [respective topic](CustomProperties) for more information on this subject.
-   **ShowPlayerCharacter** - if set to FALSE, then the player character will be disabled (turned invisible and immobile) when the room is loaded. Also the standard "WalkTo" cursor mode will be disabled. Note that you may achieve similar effect using property ["Character.on"](Character#characteron) and function ["Mouse.DisableMode"](Mouse#mousedisablemode) in script.

### Roon Events

-   **Enters room before fade-in** - (`RoomLoad`) triggers when the player enters the room, before the fade-in animation has played.
-   **Enters room after fade-in** - (`RoomAfterFadeIn`) triggers when the player enters the room, after the fade-in animation has played. 
-   **First time enters room** - (`RoomFirstLoad`) triggers when the player enters the room for the first time, after the fade-in.  
-   **Leaves room before fade-out** - (`RoomLeave`) triggers when the player is leaving the room (likely because a `ChangeRoom`), before the fade-out animation has played.
-   **Leaves room after fade-ou** - (`RoomUnload`) triggers after the fade-out animation has played, before leaving the room.
-   **Repeatedly execute** - (`RoomRepExec`) triggers once per frame, after all the script modules `repeatedly_execute` happens but before the `repeatedly_execute_always` happens in the same frame.
-   **Walks off left edge** - (`RoomLeaveLeft`) triggers when player goes left of the left edge.
-   **Walks off right edge** - (`RoomLeaveRight`) triggers when player goes right of the right edge.
-   **Walks off bottom edge** - (`RoomLeaveBottom`) triggers when player goes down of the bottom edge.
-   **Walks off top edge** - (`RoomLeaveTop`) triggers when player goes up of the top edge.

### Edges

Edges are moved by clicking and dragging them, once their layer is selected. If
you have trouble locating them, the properties which correspond to each edge's
position are:

- `TopEdgeY`
- `BottomEdgeY`
- `LeftEdgeX`
- `RightEdgeX`

### Objects

As described above, right clicking on the room when the Object layer is active
allows you to create a new object. Objects can be freely positioned in the room,
and whilst an object is selected you can edit its properties within the
Properties control. While dragging an Object its x and y position will be shown
on screen. The anchor point for positioning is the object's bottom left corner.

### Characters

As described above, a character will only be available to show in a room if the
character is configured to start in this room. Whilst dragging a Character its
x and y position will be shown on screen. The anchor point for positioning is
at the bottom-middle point of the character - the position should roughly match
the middle of the characters feet.

### Room masks (Hotspot, Walkable areas, Walk-behinds and Regions)

AGS offers a simple drawing editor when one of these layers is selected, so that
you can directly edit these mask areas. The tools offered include a picker, a
line tool, a freehand tool, a rectangle tool, and an area fill tool.

Also available is a way to import and export all mask areas as a bitmap image.
These options are offered in-case you prefer to draw these areas in your
preferred external image editor.

**NOTE:** Mask images must be using a 16-color (4-bit) or 256-color (8-bit)
indexed color palette, where color 0 signifies transparency and colors 1-15 are
used as the respective hotspot/walk-behind/walkable area numbers
